            <p className="md:text-lg lg:w-[30%]">Her goal is to highlight the importance of depth therapeutic work in communities, to advocate for psychotherapists to be involved in political decision-making processes that impact peopleâ€™s lives, and to raise awareness of the need for effective, accessible high-quality eating disorder treatment in the UK.</p>


<p className="md:text-lg lg:w-[30%]">Sarah believes in making psychotherapy known, available, accessible, and relevant to people of all generations. She recognises that a limited number of NHS prescribed counselling sessions are often insufficient to address the chronic widespread psychological and psycho-spiritual suffering experienced by many.</p>
